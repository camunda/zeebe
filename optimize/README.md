# Camunda Optimize

Camunda Optimize is an extension to Camunda Platform for enterprise customers,
that provides continuous monitoring and insights about your deployed
business processes.

## Building Optimize

Apache Maven 3 and Java JDK 17 are prerequisites for building Camunda
Optimize. Once you have setup Java and Maven, run

```
mvn clean install
```

And if you don't want to run the tests

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

**On Windows** make sure you run this in a command line as Administrator

- as some npm modules need to be able to create symlinks.

After the build is completed, you will find the distributions under ```
optimize-distro/target ```

the [Front-End README](./client/README.md)

## Backend

Learn how to build, debug, test and more in the back-end in the [Back-End README](backend/README.md)

## Development Setup

### Docker

You can start the platform (with C7 engine) with H2 by issuing:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you need a postgres backend for the engine, you can use a different docker-compose
file. In this case the command is: ``` docker-compose -f
docker-compose.postgresql.yml up -d ```

This will start Elasticsearch and a PostgreSQL-backed Camunda Platform 7 instance.
The services are exposed to localhost on the following ports:

- Elasticsearch: 9200, 9300
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- CamBPM: 8080

Services can be shutdown again using

```
docker-compose down
```

You can also run Optimize in C8SM mode (Self-managed C8 Engine) by running the following command

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ccsm-with-optimize.yml up -d
```

or optionally the C8SM stack without Optimize using:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ccsm-without-optimize.yml up -d
```

This will start all the components of Identity, Elasticsearch, Zeebe, and Optimize. Optimize will be
available at localhost:8090.

Optimize then needs to be started in C8SM mode, and with the following environment variables:

```
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=ccsm;
CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_ISSUER_URL=[Identity host]
CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_CLIENTID=optimize;
CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_CLIENTSECRET=[must match the one in docker-compose.ccsm.yml]
CAMUNDA_OPTIMIZE_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE=[audience]
```

## F.A.Q

# Docker is telling me that I do not have the rights to pull the images

You probably did not login in Camunda's private Docker registry. Since we
are using enterprise images that are available only to paying customer it
is necessary to authenticate with:

```
docker login registry.camunda.cloud
```

You can use your LDAP credentials to continue the authentication.

# Supporting multiple versions of Camunda Platform

Optimize supports multiple versions of Camunda Platform 7. It is possible to use these
versions by specifying different maven profiles. In particular, you can
have a look at the root pom.xml files. It contains a profile for every
version that Optimize supports (e.s. engine-latest, engine-7.11).

## Running integration tests locally

You can run locally integration tests using maven. The command to run the
tests is the following:

```
mvn -Pit,engine-latest -pl backend -am clean install
```

You can replace the profile `engine-latest` with the version of Camunda Platform 7 you
want to test against.

## Debugging integration tests locally with IntelliJ

You can use the debugger integrated within IntelliJ to go through any integration test
directly. The only prerequisite is that your IntelliJ is already configured to run or debug
Optimize.

From a fresh environment (i.e., no docker containers are running), all you need is the containers
defined in the default `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

Once the containers are running, you need to prepare the test environment:

```bash
$ mvn pre-integration-test -Pit,engine-latest -pl backend -am -Dskip.fe.build
```

After this, you are free to set breakpoints in the code and debug any integration test using
IntelliJ.

## Modifying Camunda Platform 7 version being tested

Whenever there is a new release of the platform, we need to update the
`pom.xml` file, in order to test against the latest codebase.

The version that each profile is pulling is stored in the
`camunda.engine.version` property of the corresponding profile. Just
update this version with the updated version.
